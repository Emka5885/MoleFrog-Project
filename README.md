<h3>Description :page_facing_up:</h3>

"MoleFrog" - is a simple game from the series "Mole, Frog and a Duck are taking over the world!".

The player's task is to score as many points as possible by collecting candy. However, in doing so, you have to constantly watch out for ghosts!
To make it easier to evade opponents on the map mole mounds have been added, between which the player can move. The catch, however, is that if you take the risk of jumping into a mound, you never know what other mound you will land in, making it possible to jump right into the hands of a ghost!
The game ends when the player loses all lives.

The project was created to learn about the SDL library.
